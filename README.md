OFFLINE MULTIMODAL RAG SYSTEM


To build a modular, model-agnostic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that runs offline on consumer hardware, supports unified retrieval across text, PDFs, images, audio, and video, integrates systematic evaluation of retrieval and generation quality, and supports both offline and API-based LLM backends for scalable deployment.
